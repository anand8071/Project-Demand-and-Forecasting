# Project-Demand-and-Forecasting
Business Objective:

Demand Forecasting:

This Demand Forecasting will help businesses to predict the quantity of goods and services, which will be demanded by consumers. If we forecast the customer demand for the future, it will be useful to make good business and that is where Data Scientist’s or any person who will handle the data will come into picture.


We had a requirement related to forecasting the demand from a business point, and found sample data from the web. We will be having a sample of 2 years of Historical data and asking to forecast the next year.


Final Deployment should be done in Either Flask, Streamlit, AWS up to the interest of the team.

Data Set Details:
train.csv
•	The training data, comprising time series of features store_nbr, family, and onpromotion as well as the target sales.
•	store_nbr identifies the store at which the products are sold.
•	family identifies the type of product sold.
•	sales gives the total sales for a product family at a particular store at a given date. Fractional values are possible since products can be sold in fractional units (1.5 kg of cheese, for instance, as opposed to 1 bag of chips).
•	onpromotion gives the total number of items in a product family that were being promoted at a store at a given date.

Acceptance criteria:

The project work would be accepted and deemed completed upon meeting the following criteria:
o	All possible models with different algorithms should be evaluated
o	90-95% accuracy alongside a least error should be attained
o	The models should be deployment ready and should be easily understood by non-technical/business teams
